# Attendance Tracker App

A Flutter-based attendance management app designed to help students monitor and manage their attendance efficiently. This app allows students to calculate how many classes they need to attend to cover a shortage or how many they can afford to miss if they have a good attendance record.

## Features
- **Attendance Shortage Calculator**: If a student has a shortage in attendance, they can enter the number of classes conducted and attended to determine how many more they need to attend to meet the required percentage.
- **Bunk Planner**: If a student has sufficient attendance, they can enter the same details to check how many classes they can afford to miss without falling below the required threshold.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter** for cross-platform development
- **Dart** as the programming language
